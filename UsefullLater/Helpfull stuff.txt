View uses Css html and javascript and C#
View is just a part of your page

controllers link the view with the data

[HttpPost]
method 
this sends data from the form to this method

HomeController : Controller

public actionresult index()
return view

will look for the Home file in views and then Index


Model is a class with properties



@RenderBody takes the view in there (from Index for example)
if you want to go to the about page it takes the index code out of the @Ren
and puts the about in 

@ says that its going to use C# stuff
@Html.ActionLink("Home", "Index", "Home")
Home controller, Index cshtml, page is called Home
